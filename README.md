<h4>üí¨Story background & Description</h4>
PlaneWar is a classic shooting game in which the player takes the role of a pilot and fights in the air aboard a fighter jet to defend the land against the formidable air power of the enemy. This aerial war will test every pilot's skill, courage, and loyalty. In the game, you must dodge enemy planes while using your weapons to attack them, shoot them down, and protect your fighter from being hit. 
<br></br>
The gameplay of PlaneWar is simple and intuitive, but as the number of shoot-downs increases, the game becomes more challenging. The game was so popular that it became part of many players' childhood memories. Now, we are waiting for you to join the military conflict in the air, become the most excellent pilot to fight over an evil army, and save the world!

<h2>Purpose of this Software</h2>
<div>
  <p>Our group has decided this project is time-to-market because the content of our software could be more memorable. Furthermore, our development time is limited, so we must publish as soon as possible. The development process is trending toward the agile side for strategic fit because a runnable program is more important than a full version or quality-based software. Therefore, we have made a short-term version first and will get an update after. At last, version 1.0 is our final product. We are aiming for the game industry as our target market. If we are developing in a fundamental business matter, we may plan a beta test for customers and then get feedback for upgrading.</p>
</div>


<h2>Software development plan</h2>
<ol>
  
<li>   <strong>Game concept design:</strong> In this stage, we must discuss the basic gameplay, content, level design, game rules, etc. We must also decide on the game's style, theme, and target audience.  </li>
  <br>
  
  <li><strong>Game design:</strong> In this stage, we must design the game's gameplay, enemy, player combat, and level details. We must consider game difficulty, balance, and pacing factors and optimize the gaming experience.</li>
  <br>
  
  <li>  <strong>Programming:</strong> In this stage, we must decide which programming language to use and write the game's code. Programmers must create game objects, characters, scenes, UI, etc., and implement all the features in the game design. During this stage, multiple tests and debugging are required.  </li>
  <br>
  
  <li> <strong>Art design:</strong> In this stage, we must create the game's art assets, including player and enemy combat vehicle models and scene design. We must consider the game's style and theme, creating a pleasing gaming experience. Some art design software, such as Photoshop and Maya, will be needed at this stage.
   </li><br>
  
  <li>   <strong>Testing and optimization:</strong> In this stage, we must conduct multiple tests and optimizations to ensure the game's stability and smoothness. We must fix all errors and bugs and optimize the game's performance and user experience. </li>
   <br>
  <li>  <strong>Programming:</strong> Same as process three but just for adding a new feature.  </li>
  <br>
  
  <li> <strong>Art design:</strong> Art design for the updated program.
   </li><br>
  
  <li> <strong>Testing and optimization:</strong> In this stage, we must fix all errors and bugs and optimize the game's performance and user experience.</li><br>
  
 <li> We have continued the same process until version 1.0 is finished.</li>
